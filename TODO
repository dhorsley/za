1.0.13 fixes

    * TODO remove deprecated features and options (startup options, dead code, unused funcs)

    * investigate current Windows functionality: tests failed on:
        - fixed - missing CTE code
        - eg/plots/life: doesn't fail, but doesn't display either.. utf-8 issue probably.
        - eg/async3: failed due to os detection + date commands probably.
        - mon and others: release_id() doesn't work on windows. (probably other release type internal funcs too)

    * TODO fix statement line calc (lex.go + actor.go)

    * TODO library function name review (for consistency)

    * TODO review startup defaults:
        - windows       - ansi on or off?
        - unix/linux    - startup a shell or not?
        - all           - extra mutex locks on or off?
    
    * TODO remove dead eg/examples, review rest.

    * TODO update manual.
        - range s..e doc
            - high->low ranges are currently a syntax error
        - when HAS clause doc
        - when condition now optional. assumes "true" const value when missing.

    * TODO add more manual example code in tools/funpages/examples for more functions.

    * TODO allow PRINT[LN] to be interrupted.

    * TODO fix: PRINT against large object (e.g. [50000000]int ) takes a lot of time to de-allocate after completion.

LATER
-----

*TODO*  dormant functions
            - need a way to yield and make a function dormant and re-entrant.
                - this would allow for generators and some other operations.
                - there's no particular priority for this, just a nice to have.

UNDECIDED
---------

* WHEN...ENDWHEN
    * add a range operator? x..y
    * add a generic condition evaluator? 
    * multiple options in IS?
    * fall-through? veering towards "no" for this.

* ultimately, change interactive mode to use readline or similar with better utf-8 support.
    * as usual, really low priority on this. i only wanted it for Â£ symbols!
