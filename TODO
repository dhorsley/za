LATER
-----

        operators
*TODO*          - todo: three-way comparison for scalars and array of built-ins
                    - may be wasted effort for any benefit it would bring

*TODO*  dormant functions

            - need a way to yield and make a function dormant and re-entrant.
                - this would allow for generators and some other operations.
                - there's no particular priority for this, just a nice to have.

UNDECIDED
---------

* WHEN...ENDWHEN
    * multiple options in IS?
    * fall-through? veering towards "no" for this.

* ultimately, change interactive mode to use readline or similar with better utf-8 support.
    * as usual, really low priority on this. i only wanted it for Â£ symbols!
