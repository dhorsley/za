LATER
-----

* windows keypress() (getch function):

    * working now, but modifier keys (shift, ctrl, etc) all throw a keypress into 
        the input buffer, effectively triggering the Read. This leaves the go routine
        hanging pending the second part of the keypress even after the timeout value
        has been exceeded.

    * it's not a big issue, but could do with a workaround. seems to be part of the 
        way that ReadConsoleInput and PeekConsoleInput work in Windows. 

    * still some timing issues to deal with. key debounce seems to be around 50-100ms minimum on windows.
        this affects keypress use with a timeout specified, as a timeout may occur before key up and debounce complete.

        * we either need to figure a way to make it wait patiently and report lag or put stricter limits in place.


UNDECIDED
---------

* WHEN...ENDWHEN
    * multiple options in IS?
    * fall-through? veering towards "no" for this.

* ultimately, change interactive mode to use readline or similar with better utf-8 support.
    * as usual, really low priority on this. i only wanted it for Â£ symbols!
