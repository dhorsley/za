* finish strings check
* tidy eg/mon some more

* windows keypress() (getch function):

    * working now, but modifier keys (shift, ctrl, etc) all throw a keypress into 
        the input buffer, effectively triggering the Read. This leaves the go routine
        hanging pending the second part of the keypress even after the timeout value
        has been exceeded.

    * it's not a big issue, but could do with a workaround. seems to be part of the 
        way that ReadConsoleInput and PeekConsoleInput work in Windows. 

    * not doing anything clever with language support on windows keystroke input yet...
        * for example, Â£ and # currently are both bodged to present as 35 in keypress().
