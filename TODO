BUGS
----

lots, i'm sure.

    - open braces in expressions. A missing closing parenthesis at end of expressions does not always
      trigger a syntax error. 

        - this may be more widely scoped than raised above. (square braces, quotes, etc).
        - need to test around this problem and fix (i.e. add warnings and terminate).

        - some kind of error is generally raised, but it's not always the relevent one...
            - e.g. missing end* statements on subsequent lines.

TODO
----

*TODO*  remove deprecated features and options (startup options, dead code, unused funcs)
*TODO*  add more manual example code in tools/funpages/examples for more functions.


LATER / UNDECIDED
-----------------

* library function name review (for consistency)

* review startup defaults:
    - windows       - ansi on or off?
    - unix/linux    - startup a shell or not?

* add support for structs in filter and map operators.

* dormant functions
            - need a way to yield and make a function dormant and re-entrant.
                - this would allow for generators and some other operations.
                - may be able to reuse MODE_STATIC with some work on it.
                - there's no particular priority for this, just a nice to have.

* ultimately, change interactive mode to use readline or similar with better utf-8 support.
    * as usual, really low priority on this. i only want it for Â£ symbols!
