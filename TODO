lots, i'm sure.


TODO
----

    * There are currently a few issues in the Windows build around async and ui operations.
        - i'll get to these eventually, but not rushing them. only the linux/alpine builds are
            considered to be of any import currently.
        - there's likely to be a few more breaking bugs exhibiting in the windows build before
            we get to a stable state on Linux. they'll get ironed out over time.


LATER / UNDECIDED
-----------------

    * need to (re)consider structs as struct member types.
        - initially, this did not seem useful for the language. in all honesty, it still doesn't,
           but it might allow for other use cases. it also adds a fair amount of complexity that
           we may be better without.

    * add ref and mut directives/operators for use in function calls?

    In principle, we are generally trying to avoid passing variables by reference to allow for their
    mutation in a call. However, it has proven useful at least a few times when constructing the
    library to allow this. 

    The compromise, so far, was to indicate the variable name with the REF operator rather than
    putting variable names in strings during the call. It makes clear the intent of the use while
    still not mutating the variable during the call. We have no aspirations towards pure function calls,
    however we did want to give clarity for readers of the code what was going on.

    As we have needed to do this ourselves then surely normal programming with the language would
    deem it necessary to allow for call-by-reference or call-by-copy-restore.  This may be the case, 
    but we are still trying to avoid it. 

    In case we do change our mind, then we will likely extend calls to make the REF and MUT operators 
    both act as a literal reference to the variable name but to also pass a usage flag through the call:

        REF n  : read-only reference to caller variable 'n'
        MUT n  : reference to caller variable 'n'. Work with copy during call. On exit, write the result
                    back to the caller variable 'n'.

    To accomplish this we would need to:

        - move the callFunction argument wrangling that happens everywhere to the start of the Call function.
            - this is needed as the arguments are evaluated ahead of the functionArgs comparisions done
                inside Call(). I.e. the required information is lost by that stage.
            - it would also unify the various methods of processing args currently done all over the place.
            - this would possibly also reduce the lock count at function call startup.

        - add code in function arg processing to add a mutable field with "mut" operator (probably quite
            a minor change code-wise as we already have a processing loop for this, we just need a case for
            setting the 'mut' flag.)

        - add code on function exit to mutate caller state with updated values (we already do this to 
            a certain extent for the retval/retvar handling, so this would be an extension.)

        - maybe other stuff i can't think of right now.

    Without those additional changes, ref/mut are usable as synonyms for ` "variable" `.

    The above would quite clearly be a substantial structure change from how things are now. It's not 
    a lot of code, but it would require much testing. It's made more problematic in that as soon as I start
    ripping that code apart there's a few other changes that I would feel compelled to make while in there.


    * ultimately, change interactive mode to use readline or similar with better utf-8 support.
