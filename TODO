BUGS
----

lots, i'm sure.


TODO
----

    * coalesce windows/linux builds.
        - lib-os is missing some functions in windows file, but probably only
            things which Windows FS doesn't support. need to confirm.

    * windows build (17-11-2021):
        - mostly working in ConEmu/Windows Terminal
        - something is amiss in the window scrolling/terminal height info as the bottom-of-screen
            scrolling is misbehaving and has occasional artifacts.
        - Probably just need to detect Windows and use a different combination of ansi codes
            to perform the scroll and check cursor vertical positions in interactive mode.
        - background colours in help line current selection highlight.
            - only the first item in list has background changed, and left/right selections
                only move the highlight asterisk and not the bg change.


LATER / UNDECIDED
-----------------

    * make fixed size variable backing stores dynamic arrays.
        - currently a fixed var count per func of 320(?)
        - this should be autoscaled instead as it slows down recursion and reserves a little more
            memory than really necessary.
        - it was previously dynamic under the last var storage scheme, just have not got around
            to doing anything about it yet.

    * ultimately, change interactive mode to use readline or similar with better utf-8 support
        (because I'm not likely to make many more changes to the in-built line editor):
        
        - some escaped chars (e.g. \") screw with the nesting check in interactive mode.
        - plenty of utf-8/extended char set keys still not working in interactive mode.
            - e.g. · µ n ”“ ¢ «» and similar.
