* finish strings check

* windows keypress() (getch function):

    * working now, but modifier keys (shift, ctrl, etc) all throw a keypress into 
        the input buffer, effectively triggering the Read. This leaves the go routine
        hanging pending the second part of the keypress even after the timeout value
        has been exceeded.

    * it's not a big issue, but could do with a workaround. seems to be part of the 
        way that ReadConsoleInput and PeekConsoleInput work in Windows. 

* ultimately, change interactive mode to use readline or similar with better utf-8 support.
    * as usual, really low priority on this. i only wanted it for Â£ symbols!

* more removals to do of temp files from WITH.

    * definite artifacts left over, for example, if you do a mismatch like WITH...; ... ; ENDWHEN.
        * the with clause closes off without removing the temp.

* tail recursion elimination
    * we are currently blindly copying in arguments from recursive return caller to the entry arguments
        * this needs some type checking around it (using functionArgs list).
            Not too bothered if it gets wrong results and continues, but should at least warn when this happens.

* either CLS or AT is interfering with continuity during eg/all tests. Something amiss there in terminal control.
    probably not a big problem, was working okay previously and those statements haven't been touched for a long time,
    so it is probably a peculiarity of the terminal. check anyway.
