BUGS
----

lots, i'm sure.

    * row,col globals will definitely cause race conditions.
        * anything asynchronous that shifts the cursor position around rapidly
            could break these. it is very fixable, just painful.
        * we could use a better way of doing this. we need to hold state for the terminal
            cursor globally as it is incredibly slow trying to pull this information from
            the VT handlers directly. (It involves sending a command to the VT in an
            out-of-band mode.)
        * it shouldn't matter for "normal" use of the language, but anything that tries
            to be clever with screen updates can race currently.
        * don't want to do it, but may have to look at third-party atomic handlers if we
            want a quick fix otherwise it means adding locking code in a rather large
            number of areas.

TODO
----

*TODO*  remove deprecated features and options (startup options, dead code, unused funcs)
*TODO*  add more manual example code in tools/funpages/examples for more functions.


LATER / UNDECIDED
-----------------

* library function name review (for consistency)

* review startup defaults:
    - windows       - ansi on or off?
    - unix/linux    - startup a shell or not?

* add support for structs in filter and map operators.

* dormant functions
            - need a way to yield and make a function dormant and re-entrant.
                - this would allow for generators and some other operations.
                - may be able to reuse MODE_STATIC with some work on it.
                - there's no particular priority for this, just a nice to have.

* ultimately, change interactive mode to use readline or similar with better utf-8 support.
    * as usual, really low priority on this. i only want it for Â£ symbols!
