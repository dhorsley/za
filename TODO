        * bug in array element parsing.
            * map keys containing commas bug out during eval when in double quotes
                however, they are fine in backticks. this may be the third party eval
                routines doing some thing odd with commas in numeric literals/lists or
                it could just be the way they are getting passed to it.

        * bug in lex'ing or command processing. command ending in double quote sometimes poluting subsequent commands.
            * probably same source as bug above. can wrap commands in back-ticks to work around it.
