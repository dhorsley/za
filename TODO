BUGS
----

lots, i'm sure.


TODO
----

    * There may currently be a few issues in the Windows build around async.
        - i'll get to these eventually, but not rushing them. only the linux/alpine builds are
            considered to be of any import currently.
    * 23-09-2021: tested windows build again.
        - it required a little update in console_windows.go to compile and does still function.
        - however, there are several feature changes and fixes not yet included in it.
        - will be worth splitting more of the code to the console_common.go file.
        - lib-os_windows.go is also quite out of date now, with missing lib calls.
            - this may be okay for some of them, as not all calls are supported under windows,
                but needs checking and documenting.

    * coalesce windows/linux builds.
        - lib-os is missing some functions in windows file, but probably only
            things which Windows FS doesn't support. need to confirm.


LATER / UNDECIDED
-----------------

    * make fixed size variable backing stores dynamic arrays.
        - currently a fixed var count per func of 320(?)
        - this should be autoscaled instead as it slows down recursion and reserves a little more
            memory than really necessary.
        - it was previously dynamic under the last var storage scheme, just have not got around
            to doing anything about it yet.
        - may be worth marking stores as "getting full" somewhere in bind_int and having an
            async routine to check and expand candidates. (i.e. like some sort of deranged
            garbage collector in reverse.)

    * ultimately, change interactive mode to use readline or similar with better utf-8 support.
