LATER / UNDECIDED
-----------------

*TODO*  automate setting of lockSafety flag, when:
        * web service active
        * async call active
        * any other form of concurrency active

*TODO*  remove deprecated features and options (startup options, dead code, unused funcs)

*TODO*  library function name review (for consistency)

*TODO*  review startup defaults:
    - windows       - ansi on or off?
    - unix/linux    - startup a shell or not?

*TODO remove dead eg/examples, review rest.
*TODO add more manual example code in tools/funpages/examples for more functions.

*TODO*  add support for structs in filter and map operations.

*TODO*  dormant functions
            - need a way to yield and make a function dormant and re-entrant.
                - this would allow for generators and some other operations.
                - there's no particular priority for this, just a nice to have.

* ultimately, change interactive mode to use readline or similar with better utf-8 support.
    * as usual, really low priority on this. i only wanted it for Â£ symbols!
