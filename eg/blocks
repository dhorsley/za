# CAVEATS:
#  1. escaped chars are probably going to cause problems.
#  2. you have to avoid or, at least, be very careful with curly braces
#       (they are used by Za for string interpolation too)
#  3. if you need to use curly braces, then you should probably use the 
#       |, =| =< variants as they can be more tolerant
#       however, nested curly braces are now possible inside shell blocks,
#       if you need to pass Za expressions. {=...}
#  4. for clarity, be consistent with the shell call methods you use.
#       ( we have | , =| , =< , {...} , ${...} , system() and other methods )
#  5. you can mix in things like the Za colour codes as the strings are
#       interpolated before getting passed to the shell.
#  6. the default child shell is Bash. you can specify others, but be
#       aware that it is the one your shell script snippets most likely
#       will need to be compatible with. (specify other shells with -s Za argument)
#  7. You can specify the -S argument to disable the child shell and cause
#       shell commands lines to execute separately in the parent process.
#       This happens by default in Windows.
#  8. we use a command output separator byte to break apart activity in the
#       child shell. if for any reason you need the default separator (0x1e),
#       then an alternative can be specified with the -U Za argument.
#  9. if you use -S you will lose access to shell env vars such as $HOME et al
# 10. also, you should be aware that a mutex activates during child shell calls...
#       this means you may well end up not speeding things up when mixing async calls
#       in to the workflow. no other way to do this sanely. 
#       this doesn't occur when using -S / coproc(false).
#       ... just another reason to keep your processing inside Za where possible.
