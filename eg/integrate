    Just to prove how bad Za is at math...
    Not really willing to do anything about this without rewriting the whole language!
    Obviously, that isn't happening just yet. Basic value types are wrapped in both
    a struct and an inner interface{} in Go. They also have to be checked, potentially
    through a mutex in some cases, for safe multi-threaded use.
    This is not going to lead to great performance. However, it makes the design easy
    and offers a lot of flexibility without much work. Numeric processing performance
    is not exactly a design goal!
