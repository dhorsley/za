Please note:

    These tests are still a little buggy where they use asynchronous loops for handling console input.

    I haven't checked yet, but I'm fairly sure this is a consequence of trying to multiplex console access
    rather than an inherent fault with concurrency within the language. 

    If you have any problems with a terminal stalling just sigkill the Za pid. No harm done ;)

    What I'm trying to say is... keep console access simple, or use lib-ui for more complex front-ends.

    (also: it could definitely be a language bug - it just isn't my gut feeling!)
