The tests in this directory are very out of date now.

Coverage was also low. 

When these are updated, there will be no attempt to cover the lib-* files.

All of the library should have tests written in Za itself. This has not been done 
in a formal way yet either. 

I know, terrible of me.  It's just not important enough yet.  I would like to get
these up to date, but it's a lot of work for little personal gain :)

Most things get tested fairly well by hand but if there's any real interest then 
these and the library tests will be more formalised.
